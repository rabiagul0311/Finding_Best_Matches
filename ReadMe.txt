Features matching or generally image matching, a part of many computer vision applications such as image registration, camera calibration and object recognition, is the task of establishing correspondences between two images of the same scene/object. A common approach to image matching consists of detecting a set of interest points each associated with image descriptors from image data. Once the features and their descriptors have been extracted from two or more images, the next step is to establish some preliminary feature matches between these images.
